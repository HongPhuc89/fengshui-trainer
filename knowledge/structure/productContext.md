# Product Context – AI Book Trainer

## 🌟 Problem Statement

Traditional reading is passive. Learners often struggle to retain information from books because there is no immediate feedback mechanism or way to test their understanding. Creating manual quizzes for every book is time-consuming for educators and self-learners.

## 🎯 Product Vision

Build an intelligent platform that transforms any book into an interactive course. By leveraging AI, the system automatically generates assessments, tracks progress, and adapts to the learner's pace, making knowledge retention efficient and engaging.

## 👥 User Goals

- **Admins/Educators**:
  - Effortlessly convert static books (PDF/Text) into interactive learning modules.
  - Monitor student progress and identify areas where they struggle.
- **Learners**:
  - Read and learn from books with structured guidance.
  - Test their knowledge immediately after reading a chapter.
  - Track their mastery of the subject matter over time.

## 🧭 User Experience Principles

- **Focus on Content**: The reading interface should be clean and distraction-free.
- **Seamless Assessment**: Exams should feel like a natural part of the learning process, not a stressful barrier.
- **Immediate Feedback**: Users should know instantly if they understood the material.
- **Accessibility**: Support for various devices to allow learning anywhere.

## 🔍 Usage Scenarios

- **Corporate Training**: A company uploads a compliance manual. Employees read it and take an auto-generated exam to certify their understanding.
- **Self-Study**: A student uploads a textbook. The system quizzes them on each chapter to ensure they are ready for their real exam.
- **Language Learning**: A user uploads a novel in a target language. The system generates vocabulary quizzes.

## ⛔ Out of Scope (MVP)

- **Social Features**: No chat or social sharing initially.
- **Marketplace**: No selling of books or courses (internal use or free content only).
- **Complex Media**: No support for video or audio parsing in the first version.
