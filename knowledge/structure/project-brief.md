# Project Brief – AI Book Trainer

## 🧠 Purpose

The AI Book Trainer is an intelligent educational platform designed to transform static reading materials into interactive learning experiences. It allows administrators to upload books (PDF/Text), which are then processed to create structured learning paths and AI-generated exams for users.

## 🧩 Core Features

- **Book Management (Admin)**: Upload, update, and manage books.
- **Content Processing**: Automatic extraction of chapters and content from uploaded books.
- **Learning Interface (User)**: Interactive reader with progress tracking.
- **AI Exam Generation**: Dynamic creation of quizzes and exams based on book content.
- **Performance Tracking**: Detailed analytics on user progress and exam results.
- **User Management**: Role-based access control (Admin vs. User).

## 🎯 Goals

- **Enhance Learning Efficiency**: Make reading more interactive and measurable.
- **Automate Assessment**: Reduce the burden of creating manual tests by using AI.
- **Track Progress**: Provide users and admins with clear insights into learning achievements.
- **Scalability**: Support a growing library of books and a large user base.

## 🧑‍💻 Target Users

- **Administrators**: Content managers responsible for uploading and organizing educational materials.
- **Learners/Students**: Individuals seeking to master the content of the books through structured reading and testing.
- **Organizations**: Companies or schools looking to provide training materials to employees or students.

## 💡 Key Constraints

- **AI Accuracy**: Generated questions must be relevant and accurate to the source material.
- **File Format Support**: Must reliably handle common book formats (PDF, TXT, Markdown).
- **Data Privacy**: User progress and exam results must be secure.
- **Performance**: Content processing and exam generation should be efficient.
